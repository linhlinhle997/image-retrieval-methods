# Image Retrieval Methods

This repository contains two approaches to image retrieval:
1. **Traditional Image Retrieval** 
2. **Embedding-based Image Retrieval**

## Contents

- `image_retrieva_traditional`: Implements traditional methods for image retrieval, focusing on similarity metrics like L1, L2 distances, Cosine Similarity, Correlation Coefficient.
- `image_retrieva_embedding`: Utilizes modern embedding techniques, such as CLIP, for more semantically accurate image retrieval.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image_retrieval_methods.git
    cd image_retrieval_methods
    ```
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook to explore different image retrieval methods:
    - `Traditional Approach`: Open `image_retrieval_traditional` to experiment with classic similarity-based retrieval methods.
    - `Embedding Approach`: Open `image_retrieval_embedding` to use embedding-based retrieval techniques like CLIP.
