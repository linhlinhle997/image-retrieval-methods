# Image Retrieval Methods

This repository contains two approaches to image retrieval:
1. **Traditional Image Retrieval** 
2. **Embedding-based Image Retrieval**

## Contents

- `image_retrieva_traditional`: Implements traditional methods for image retrieval, focusing on similarity metrics like L1, L2 distances, Cosine Similarity, Correlation Coefficient.
- `image_retrieva_embedding`: Utilizes modern embedding techniques, such as CLIP, for more semantically accurate image retrieval.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image_retrieval_methods.git
    ```

2. Explore the methods:
    - Traditional Approach: Open `image_retrieva_traditional` for classic similarity-based retrieval.
    - Embedding Approach: Open `image_retrieva_embedding` for embedding-based retrieval using techniques like CLIP.
